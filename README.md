# Starting with Raspberry Pi 2, servo controllers and Windows 10 
Probably you're new with Raspberry Pi 2 or maybe not, but something that could be possible it's if you're starting with RP2 and Windows 10 you didn't find many basic examples to start with servos. One of the advantages in other platforms where RP2 has been a playing for long time it's the packages to help us build more complex solution. This code is a simplified version to learn how to controll servos on raspberry pi 2 and windows 10 based in one -Robot kit- from the Microsoft page. This code just contains the base code to help you to control a servo.

# GPIO
In this example the GPIO that we will use are:
```C#
        const int LEFT_PWM_PIN = 5;
        const int RIGHT_PWM_PIN = 6;
```
